    <h1>Lost in Translation: A Quest to Find Your Way Through the Seven Stones in Mwotlap</h1>
    
    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>It all began with a bottle washed ashore.</p>
        
        <p>David, a travel blogger drawn to the unexpected, found it half-buried in the sand months ago. Inside was a letter—weathered, sun-bleached, and written in a language he couldn't recognize.</p>
        
        <p>He turned to Reddit for help. Weeks passed. Then months. Just when he was ready to give up, a message finally arrived.</p>
        
        <p>It was from Vetea, a young man from Vanuatu who spoke Mwotlap—a language spoken by only around 2,000 people on the island of Motalava. Vetea had read the letter. It described seven mystic stones hidden across the islands, along with cryptic directions to find them. Three matched the description of stones once discovered by his grandfather—mysterious, glimmering relics etched with unexplainable patterns.</p>
        
        <p>According to the letter, the author—a Mwotlap traveler—had scattered the stones across Vanuatu, turning their hiding places into a game, and leaving clues behind for those curious enough to follow.</p>
        
        <p>Now, with mystery calling and clues in hand, David joins Vetea on a journey into the heart of the Pacific—chasing legends, decoding directions, and hunting for the lost Seven Mystic Stones.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="dramatic-break">
        But fate had other plans...
    </div>
    
    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>The Accident</h2>
        <p>Some time into their search, Vetea was injured in an accident and has been in a coma ever since.</p>
        
        <p>Knowing time isn't on his side—and suspecting that others who saw the letter online might also be after the stones—David decides to press on alone. His only clues? The cryptic letter, the paths they've travelled (now carefully marked on his map), and his past interactions with Vetea's grandfather, Kaikoa.</p>
        
        <p>Trying to recall as many details as he can about the language and the clues, David's memory drifts back to the beginning of their journey—to Motalava, where Mwotlap is primarily spoken, and to Kaikoa's warm welcome that first set everything in motion.</p>

        <p>Their next stop is <span class="mwotlap">na-Pnō Men</span>, or the Bird Island, an abandoned island with some secret maze underground. David traced their route on a map of the island and a map of the maze that he drew himself.</p>

        <h2>The Disaster</h2>
        <p>Following the hints on the letter, they managed to label where huts A-C are on the map, but they still had to find out which hut held the stone. As it stands, every hut has a rock on one side and they have to determine which stone is the rock really under.</p>
        
        <p>As they were trying to solve the puzzle of selecting the right rock, something bad went down. David mistakenly dug down under the wrong rock and apparently it triggered some explosive device. Vetea immediately recognized the countdown beeps and realized it was planted by the creator of the puzzle to eliminate people making the wrong choice. In a panic, he yelled "That's not what yow means here!" and tried to throw himself at David to push him away, which ended up landing himself on the bomb that then promptly exploded. The accident sent him into a coma and now David is unfortunately on his own.</p>

    <div class="challenge">
        <h3>Challenge 1: Figure out what Vetea means</h3>
        <p>Even in the realization that he is now completely alone on this journey and that his only Mwotlap contact is out, David still holds out hope. He now knows that this quest doesn't allow mistakes, as traps and bombs are now on the table for the wrong choice, which is only adding to the challenge, but he is confident the little Mwotlap he has picked up, especially regarding directions, can get him very far, possibly even all the way through the rest of their quest. He picks up the letter and the maps and tries to solve the same puzzle for the other four huts.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="challenge">
        <h3>Challenge 2: Label the huts</h3>
        <p>This time, he can't find any "rock" (or, in this case, totem pole) anywhere near the huts. He suspects the residents on the island have removed them. So he decides to put his painting skills to good use and ask the residents, who are rumored to have really good memory. He first illustrates, as much as possible, the appearance and surroundings of each hut on a piece of paper. Now he is going to ask around whether the residents remember which hut has a totem pole on the right location.</p>
